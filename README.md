# InsightsRepositoryTemplate
As the Market Research and DevOps Integration Manager at EffulgenceTech, I developed this scalable and automated framework to streamline the organization of Research Insights. Designed to enhance stakeholder engagement and promote cross-functional collaboration, this Insight Repository ensures that valuable research learnings are not only retained but actively reused across teams. 
By integrating DevOps principles such as Vrsion control, process automation, and continuous improvement, this system strengthens research visibility, accelerates decision-making, and reinforces a culture of evidence-based innovation
